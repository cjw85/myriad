# myriad
Some simple distributed computing components using only the python standard
library. The motivation for the project was to create a simple distributed
map-reduce style interface that can act as a drop-in replacement for python's
inbuilt `map` and the `itertools.imap` family. 

# Installation
myriad can be installed in the usual way with

    python setup.py install

It should be installed on all computers that will do any processing.

# Usage
myriad contains client and server components. The server manages input and
output queues, which clients can access. The basic pattern is to start a
server, push work to its input queues, launch clients, and finally collect
results from the server. An example is given in the `myriad.components`
module, which provides the myriad command-line entry point. Here's a
near-full example.

```python
from myriad.components import MyriadServer
from random import randint

host = 'localhost'
port = '12345'
key = 'auth_key'
worker = ... # mysterious function that transforms inputs to outputs

# Create a server
server = MyriadServer(worker, port, key)
# Push some jobs to the server
for _ in xrange(5):
    server.put(randint(1, 3))

# Start a client
subprocess.Popen(['myriad', '--client',
    '--host', 'localhost', '--port', port, '--key', key])
# Collect results from server
for result in server:
    print "Server got back '{}'".format(result)
```

In the above we start a subprocess running myriad with the `--client` option.
Of course this line could be amended to, for example, submit clients to a
cluster. In common with similar packages, the function `worker` must be
pickleable.
